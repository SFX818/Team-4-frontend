## Major Hurdles & Unsolved Problems 
At first, we had challenges with the slight learning curve of overall github management. 
​
Once we tackled that and got more skilled and familiar, the biggest hurdles were time, scope creep (using redux and related middlewares), and external events. If given more time, we would work to refactor our code without redux to make our app much less complicated.
